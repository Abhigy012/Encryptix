Project 1: Number Guessing Game
In this project, I designed a number guessing game with three levels of difficulty. The player tries to guess a random number in a specified space, and how many attempts were made. The game responds to every thought, showing if it was too high or too low. The task involved generating random numbers, monitoring effort, and maintaining high scores in each category. 
Project 2: Simple Calculator
This project required the development of a simple calculator capable of performing basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The account continues to accept assignments until the user enters the same symbol ('='), which displays the final result. I used a switch case statement to handle operations and ensure that errors were handled for null partitions.
Project 3: To-Do List
In my third project, I developed a dynamic to-do list application where users can add, remove, and mark tasks as complete. The application displays tasks with their completion status and updates accordingly. This project heavily utilized linked lists to manage the dynamic nature of the task list. Each task was represented as a node in the linked list, containing the task description and its completion status. The project involved implementing functions to handle various operations on the list, ensuring efficient memory management and dynamic task manipulation.
